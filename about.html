        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>To treat our customers and their resources as we would want our own to be treated, while giving money to those less fortunate.</p>
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>To be the respected, household name for quality insurance, banking, finance and financial services - known for truly caring for people and acting without greed.</p>

        <h2>About our Founder</h2>
        <p>Shan Ricketts has a unique understanding of the insurance and financial services industry.  He began his career in 1989 and, over the years worked at a home office, independent insurance agency, Financial Agency and an insurance General Agency.  He developed specific expertise in customer service and taking simplifying complex problems.</p>

        <p>For these reasons Shan was awarded the Georgia Health Underwriter of the Year Award in 2010 – the highest award a health insurance agent can achieve in the State of Georgia.  Likewise, the South Atlanta Chapter of the Associations of Health Underwriters, a Chapter of NAHU, named their highest award for their Health Underwriter of the Year, the “Shan Ricketts Award” in honor of the work he put into founding and leading their Chapter.</p>

        <p>Shan plans to use these skills, as well as his knowledge of the health, life and financial services industries to build a kinder, gentler insurance, financial services and banking organization to provide for the needs of the next generation.  His goal is to safely provide these services at the lowest possible cost, while also making less than his competitors by giving a portion of all received commissions away to those less fortunate.</p>
