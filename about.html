              <p>Shan Ricketts has served as a leader in his field since 1989, developing specific expertise in customer service and complex problem resolution and prevention.</p>

              <p>Shan has received numerous awards, including the  National AHU William F. Flood Public Service Award, the Georgia AHU Health Underwriter of the Year Award, and has spoken for both the Congress and Senate in Georgia.</p>

              <p>Shan uses these skills to build a kinder, gentler insurance, financial services and banking organization to provide for the needs of the next generation.  His goal is to safely provide these services at the lowest possible cost, while also making less than his competitors by giving a portion of all received commissions away to those less fortunate.</p>
